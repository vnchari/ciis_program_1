Instructions for building executable:
    obviously replace paths with your own paths.
    cmake is needed. generate build dir as follows:
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" -S /home/vchari/ciis/programming_assigment_one -B /home/vchari/ciis/programming_assigment_one/BUILD_DIRNAME
    then run:
        cmake --build /home/vchari/ciis/programming_assigment_one/BUILD_DIRNAME --target programming_assigment_one
Instructions for using executable:
    Example:
        ./programming_assignment_one OUTPUTDIRNAME/ input_data/pa1-unknown-a
    First argument to executable is the dir to write all output files.
    Second argument to executable is the dir AND prefix for the datafiles (e.g "input_data/pa1-unknown-a", "input_data/pa1-debug-d", etc.)
Source files and description of each file:
	main.cpp - executable file for running the PA1 program on a set of files.
	frame_lib.h - file containing methods for frame transformations, both calculating and applying them.
	register.h - file containing a Procrustes class and CoherentPointDrift class which are used to calculate a frame transformation.
	calibration.h - file with pivot_calibration_routine method to calculate the position of the calibration post.
	read_input_files.h - file containing various methods and structures for reading input files and storing data.
	write_output_files.h - file which writes the necessary data into the required output file format.
